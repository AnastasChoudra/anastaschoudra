# 👋 About Me
## 🧠 Background
![Psychology](https://img.shields.io/badge/Psychology-BSc-00bfff?style=plastic&logo=brain&logoColor=white), ![Neuroscience](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neuroscience-MSc-9932cc?style=plastic&logo=microsoft-academic&logoColor=white), and a growing folder of side-projects that mix the two with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-3776ab?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54). I like turning raw biological data into something a model can chew on—mostly for fun, always for learning.

### Key Projects
- **Heart Failure Prediction**: Built a neural network classifier using TensorFlow/Keras to predict patient survival based on clinical and demographic features.
- **Classifying X-Rays for COVID with Neural Networks** – CNN ensemble over 2-D chest images.
- **Bone-Marrow Transplant (Children) – Survival Classification** – logistic pipeline with tuned PCA, 76 % acc on 187 paediatric cases.
- **WHO Life Expectancy Analysis**: Developed a scikit-learn pipeline to predict life expectancy using global health data.
   ### 🎓 MSc Project
   My MSc thesis *"Exploring Metacognitive Sensitivity through a 3-AFC Visual Motion Discrimination Task"* : investigates how well individuals can evaluate their own cognitive processes. This research explores the relationship between confidence ratings and actual performance in visual tasks, providing insights into conscious awareness and decision-making.

## Goals
I’m working toward solid hands-on experience with brain–computer interfaces. That means:
- Deepening my grasp of real-time EEG/MEG preprocessing, artifact rejection and feature extraction
- Experimenting with different neural architectures (CNN, RNN, transformer) to decode oscillatory or evoked signals into clean control commands
- Building closed-loop prototypes—think spellers, simple robotic arms, or neuro-feedback games—that run offline first, then live on edge devices (Raspberry Pi + GPU hat or Jetson Nano)
Long-term, I’d love to contribute open-source tools that lower the barrier for researchers who want reliable, affordable BCI pipelines without reinventing the wheel.
